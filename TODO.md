## Tech

- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) worked well as a generator for the old handbook. Probably we can use it again. I might rather go with markdown than with RSt this time, but this is up for discussion. I'm also OK with looking around for another tool that can do PDF layout.
- We don't have a printing service selected yet, and should do it soon.
- The print format can be unusual, like A4. Ideas welcome.
- We organize on [here](https://chat.mnt.re/mnt/channels/town-square).
