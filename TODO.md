## Tech

- Sphinx worked well as a generator for the old handbook. Probably we can use it again. I might rather go with markdown than with RSt this time, but this is up for discussion. I'm also OK with looking around for another tool that can do PDF layout.
- We don't have a printing service selected yet, and should do it soon.
- The print format can be unusual, like A4. Ideas welcome.

## Style

- Inspiration: classic computer manuals, like ZX Spectrum, QL, Commodore 64, Amiga 500. But also LISP machines, classic Macintosh. Classic Sony, Nintendo?
