The Case
========

The case consists of the following 5 parts. All parts except the bottom plate are milled from 6061 aluminum, sand blasted and anodized.

1. **Screen Back:** housing the display and upper half of hinges
2. **Screen Front:** housing speakers and providing display bezel
3. **Main Box:** to which all PCBs (printed circuit boards) are attached via M2 screws: The keyboard from the top and motherboard, trackball/trackpad, and battery boards from the bottom. The lower half of the hinges and the system controller OLED PCB are mounted from the top as well.
4. **Bezel:** a thin part that provides a bezel for the keyboard and the system controller OLED
5. **Bottom Plate:** the bottom lid that is either milled from clear acrylic or aluminum

For easy (dis)assembly, Reform uses only M2 screws with Phillips-head everywhere (with one exception: M4 on the hinges).

When closed, the case is held shut by 4 little neodymium bar magnets which are located in the front edge of the screen enclosure and in the front of the main box.

TODO: mention that hinges can be opened >180 degrees
