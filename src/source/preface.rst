Preface
+++++++

Early in the history of the MNT Reform project, when we were still working out of apartments, we made 13 laptops mostly by hand for hardly a dozen adventurous beta testers. These were much more primitive manifestations of the device that you received today, based on an older processor and a mixture of 3D printed and aluminum parts. But they already came with an *Operator Handbook*, which consisted of about 30 manually bound pages of schematics and basic instructions for handling the prototype. It was merely a rough sketch of the book that you are reading now.

The original *Operator Handbook* turned out to be a great conversation aid and icebreaker when talking about MNT Reform with other people. We made the new handbook that you're now holding in your hands in the same spirit: to make your laptop more approachable, understandable, but also more discussible. Armed with this book, you can look up the parts that make up your MNT Reform when you take it apart, you can (re)learn the basics of the Linux shell, and you can scrawl in your own ideas.

In a world where electronics are becoming ever more secretive, MNT Reform and this book appeared against many odds -- but they are not holy artifacts. They are meant to be taken apart, studied, discussed, hacked, improved.

We made this for you. Make it your own.
