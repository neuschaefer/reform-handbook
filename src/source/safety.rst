Safety
======

Before you get started with your MNT Reform, please read these safety instructions carefully to prevent harm to yourself and your belongings.

**Electrical Shock and Fire Hazard:** Please be extra careful while and after opening the case of the device. MNT Reform uses 8 batteries in series. When fully charged, these combine to a voltage of almost 29V. The individual battery cells can deliver a lot of current. Do not touch the metal pins of the battery holders with metal tools.

Before servicing anything on the inside, **make sure that the wall power is unplugged and remove all battery cells.**

**Damage to Hearing:** The headphone output of MNT Reform can be forced to extreme volume which may damage your hearing if you are not careful. Please make sure to set the volume to 30% or less before wearing headphones connected to MNT Reform and adjust the volume to a comfortable level.
