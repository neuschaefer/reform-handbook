Safety
=============

Please be extremely careful after opening the bottom panel, as there are up to 29V generated inside
of the device which, when shorted, can cause sparks that can potentially ignite flammable material
around the device. For this reason, we advise to unplug the battery cables from the motherboard
before further disassembling the device. Do not touch/short the exposed metal pins of the battery
holders with a metal tool!
