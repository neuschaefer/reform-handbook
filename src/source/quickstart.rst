===========

To prevent discharge during shipment, the battery cables are not connected by default. After reading the :ref:`Safety` section, unscrew the 10 bottom screws and remove the bottom lid. Attach the two battery cable plugs to the battery connectors on the motherboard, then reinstall the bottom lid.

Step 2: Turn On
---------------
Insert the included SD card into the slot on the left hand side of the device.

To turn Reform on, press **Circle** and then **1**. The **Circle** key is used for system control commands. When you press **Circle**, a menu of system control functions and their shortcuts will be displayed on the OLED screen embedded in the keyboard. **1** is the shortcut for turning the system power on. Alternatively you can scroll through the menu by using the **↑** and **↓** keys and trigger the highlighted option by pressing **Enter**.

Step 3: Log In
--------------
After being powered on, the main processor will boot the operating system installed on the included SD card. The operating system's kernel will show diagnostic information as it activates all the devices in the system until finally arriving at the login prompt. To log in, enter *root* as the username at the prompt. There is no default password.

From here, you can begin installing software and using MNT Reform. If you are new to the Debian GNU/Linux operating system or want to learn about specifics of the operating system shipped with MNT Reform, please refer to the :ref:`Linux Basics` chapter.

The following chapter will introduce you to the input devices of MNT Reform.
