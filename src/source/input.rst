Input Devices
=============

Reform comes with a custom keyboard and either a trackball or a trackpad preinstalled. All of the input devices are modular and can be easily swapped in and out. They all connect via internal USB2.0 cables.

Keyboard

The layout of the MNT Reform keyboard is slightly unusual. We simplified the traditional typewriter-based layout so that the keyboard can be constructed using only two distinct key shapes (square and 1.5x). This removes the need for mechanical stabilizers for long keys and makes it easier to customize and swap keycaps to your liking. The biggest difference is the split spacebar: instead of one long key, there are two 1.5x wide space keys, with left and right Alt keys sandwiched between them. Because many advanced users remap the traditional Caps Lock key to a different function, we swapped Caps Lock for a Ctrl key. This makes the use of Ctrl key combinations more ergonomic. Next to the Ctrl key is a key with 3 dots (an ellipsis). This is normally the Menu key, but on the default Reform desktop, it is mapped to Compose (a key that allows you to generate Unicode symbols from Compose sequences). Lastly, Reform features an additional modifier key, the Hyper key, in the lower left. The idea is to let you assign this key to whatever function you require.

Trackball

The trackball works similar to a three-button mouse. Rolling the ball will push the cursor in the same direction. In addition to the standard three mouse buttons, the trackball also has two "Wheel Mode" buttons. Holding down either while moving the ball will scroll the currently focused content.
